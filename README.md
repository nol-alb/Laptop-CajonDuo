# Max MSP Patch:
The central element is the Max MSP patch and the bonk object used to detect and classify onsets from the cajon. The patch consists of particular mappings for desired classes and a custom granular synthesizer patch is run along with the cajon patch to add an additional sonic element that fills the space of the venue it will be performed at.
Ableton live is used to design the trigger sounds for each Cajon hit and the sounds were carefully crafted and EQâ€™ed to match the timbre of the cajon for a more cohesive listening and playing experience.
The patch also triggers vocal samples that cycles through simple syllables, essentially giving the cajon a new voice.
